### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1, was a favorite lab of mine because we had to implement a function definition. I was able to determine which pizza had the best bang for your buck based on the price and diameter of the pizza. This gave me the amount I would be paying per square inch. So, overall, lab 3 was great because we used a function to set the flow of what the future labs are going to be.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was also a favorite of mine because it was a game between two people, and one of the players had to guess what number the first user imputed. I thought this lab was interesting because we incorporated less than, greater, and if statements.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was one of my favorites because Iâ€™ve always been interested in blackjack, so being able to code it was incredible. In lab 6, we got introduced to input validation, where we validated command-line arguments to determine if the user inputs were valid.
